R Practice
==============
##### Author - Zac Hancock (zshancock@gmail.com)

Some of my R exercises from coursework in the Applied Data Science master's program at Syracuse. 
I used RStudio Version 1.1.383 with R version 3.4.3.

**Summary of Contents:**

*Introduction to RStudio*
>Progression of skills in data manipulation, data frame creation, creating functions and ggplot. Most of the datasets 
>used were public or built into R. 

*Naive Bayes machine learning*
>Kaggle competition "Digit Recognizer" was entered while learning Naive Bayes. I wanted to apply new skills to subject matter
>outside the coursework. The competition submission scored 83-84% accuracy, which is fairly low, but I did not use a Neural 
>Network, and only used Naive Bayes.
